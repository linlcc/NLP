# NLP Projects
In this repository, there are five Jupyter notebooks, each of which contains a NLP task and the codes that I have done.

## Project Description:
### 1. Sentiment Classification - 
Train two models to distringuish examples of two different genres of Shakespeare's plays: comedies and tragedies.

### 2-1. LanguageModeling - 
Train a character-level English language models to distinguish English documents from Brazilian Portuguese documents in the test set.

### 2-2. Sequence Prediction: Surname Generation - 
Train a model using GRU to compute a probability distribution over the set of possible characters in the surname vocabulary for each time step, then use these probability distributions to generate new surnames by learning from the training data.

### 3. Viterbi Decoder and Evaluation for Sequence Labeling - 
Build a Viterbi decoder for an LSTM named-entity recognition model (NER). Also, implement the simplest possible conditional random fields (CRFs) which can enforce some constraints but does not require any training.

### 4. Cross-Language Word Embeddings - 
Judge the usefulness of pairwise distances between words in the embedding space, then compare and evaluate the English and other languages embeddings by computing the proportion of English articles whose corresponding French article is also the closest word in embedding space.
